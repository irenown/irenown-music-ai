AI Backend - Project Status Report
This report summarizes the development progress and current state of the AuraMusic AI platform. The project has successfully transitioned to a high-performance standalone backend architecture, optimized for professional audio production and scalable API delivery.

🏗️ Core Architecture (Standalone Transition)
The project was restructured from a full-stack monorepo into a dedicated express-based Node.js backend.

Performance: Optimized for long-running AI production jobs with asynchronous processing.
Serving: Dedicated static routes for /uploads and /output, allowing for instant playback of generated masters.
Scalability: Decoupled from the frontend to allow for independent scaling and cloud deployment.
🤖 AI Production Services
We have integrated industrial-grade AI services to ensure "A-list" sound quality:

1. Vocal Isolation (ElevenLabs)
Feature: Advanced voice cleaning and isolation using the ElevenLabsClient.
Implementation: 
elevenLabsApi.js
Functionality: Removes background noise and isolates vocals from raw user recordings. Supports Speech-to-Speech re-synthesis for professional clarity.
2. Music Generation (Stability AI)
Feature: High-fidelity instrumental generation using Stable Audio.
Implementation: 
stabilityApi.js
Functionality: Generates 320kbps WAV instrumentals based on user-defined BPM and Genre prompts.
3. Mixing & Mastering (FFmpeg)
Feature: Professional-grade signal chain integration.
Implementation: 
audioProcessor.js
Key Detail: Utilizes the loudnorm filter (EBU R128) to ensure commercial-level loudness (-14 LUFS) and peak normalization (-1.5 TP).
🗄️ Persistence & Data Management (SQLite)
A robust local database system has been implemented using better-sqlite3.

Database: 
aura.db
Schema:
users: Tracks IDs, usernames, and API keys.
projects: Stores complete production history, including mixing parameters and file URLs.
Service: 
database.js
 handles all CRUD operations and initial seeding.
🛡️ Security & API Security
API Key Authentication: All production endpoints are secured via the x-api-key header.
Tier-Based Access: Middleware implemented to restrict features based on user tiers (silver, gold, platinum).
Middleware: 
auth.js
📡 API Catalog
Endpoint	Method	Security	Description
/health	GET	Public	System status and versioning.
/api/produce	POST	API Key	Orchestrate full AI production (Vocal -> Music -> Mix).
/api/projects	GET	API Key	Retrieve user's project history from the vault.
/api/projects/:id	DELETE	API Key	Permanently remove a project from history.
✅ Completed Tasks Recap
 Frontend Removal: Cleaned project of all legacy React/Vite code.
 Database Integration: Set up SQLite with better-sqlite3.
 Secure Auth: Developed API key validation and tier enforcement.
 Professional Mastering: Implemented loudnorm and compand chains in FFmpeg.
 Project Vault: Added full project management API.
Status: Backend is fully operational and ready for deployment or frontend integration.
